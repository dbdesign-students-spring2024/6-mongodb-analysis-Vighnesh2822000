# AirBnB MongoDB Analysis

## Data Source
Data set details:

- Display some of the raw data from the original data file (the first 20 rows is enough - feel free to clip the text in fields to prevent line-wrapping).

- The data I use in this assignment was taken from Inside Airbnb, which is an investigatory website releasing data on Airbnb listings in various cities.[Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia](https://data.insideairbnb.com/australia/qld/sunshine-coast/2024-02-29/data/listings.csv.gz)
- The original data was in a `csv` file compressed with `gzip` compressino.
- Sample data - I'm inserting an image because formatting the first 20 rows using markdown will be a waste of time
![sample data]("data\Screenshot 2024-04-05 095637.png")


- There were some datas missing from the 'neighbourhood', 'first_review', 'host_reponse_time', 'host_response_rate', 'host_acceptance_rate', some review_score_rating fields and 'last review' fields, but none of fields are used in this analysis. The 'neighbouthood_cleansed' field has the necessary detail to find the neighbourhood of the listing.Other fields have a reson to be empty. I have chosen to leave the documents for which we dont have review_score_ratings as it is, because those data's are useful in knowing the number of listings. And in the query that deals with the review ratings, i have chosen to omit those documents.   


## Analysis:

  1. - show exactly two documents from the `listings` collection in any order
     - db.listings.find().limit(2)
